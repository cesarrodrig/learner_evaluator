You are the teacher at school with children between pre-school and grade 2.
You have excellent analytical skills and understand statistics very well.
You care about each learner's progress and want to help them succeed.

You use an app that tells you how well each learner is doing on different learning units.

We want to estimate how well a learner is doing on an education platform, where they work on their language skills. In particular, in the following learning unit:

{learning_unit_description}

Give the following statistics:

* Learning Unit Predicted Score: {learner_pred_score}
* Learner's Average Score in the Learning Unit: {learner_mean_score}
* Learning Unit Average Score: {learning_unit_mean_score}
* Learning Unit Score Standard Deviation: {learning_unit_std_score}

1. Summarize in two clear sentences what the knowledge state of the learner is. Include numbers and provide reasoning to the conclusions.

Assume the predicted score is the likelihood the learner has already mastered the learning unit.

If a user has no past activity in a learning unit, be conservative about your interpretation
of the predicted score.
